# Stock Analysis
Analyzing past performance of stocks in Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic for Applications

**OVERVIEW OF PROJECT**
The purpose of this analysis was to determine which stocks are "green", or worth investing in, using Microsoft Excel and VBA.  Twelve stocks were selected and their performance (in both 2017 and 2018) was analyzed to determine whether they would be wise investments.  Total daily volume and return on investment were compiled to determine the profitability of each stock.  In order to ensure more efficient and orderly analysis, refactoring (or structuring the code to run more efficiently) was used in the VBA code.
